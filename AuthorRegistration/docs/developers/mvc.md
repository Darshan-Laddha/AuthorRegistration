Model And View Contoller

This feature is integrated with Spring Boot to have an interactive 
web page through which we can make **REST API** calls

The JSP pages created to have the view of different pages are
1) Index.jsp
2) Authors.jsp
3) SingleAuthor.jsp
4) SingleAuthorFetchForm.jsp

To get in depth functionality of these JSP pages 
please refer the [flow diagram](../images/flow_diagram.png)
